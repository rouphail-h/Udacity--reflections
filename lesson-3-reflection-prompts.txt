When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
well, in some cases when you are working online from another computer, or may
be if you are sending your work to a colleague and want him to see it or edit it.
or may be it is just easier, specially if it is just a plain text file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
may be these changes are done by someone else, may they need to be reviewed
first before to be added to my own project.
but indeed in many cases, i would think it is ok to have the changes updated
automatically to my own computer, since we have this kind of version control
so it would be ok to have the changes updated automatically.
