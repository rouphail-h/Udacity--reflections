What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the repository and its folders inside the location as specified
It is needed to start a version control for your works.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It is like an intermediate stage where you add a change but that you didn't
commit it yet, so it is not yet added to the working directory or saved yet onto
it, but it is an ongoing working area.
it offers the space where you are working before committing your saving.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
by checking the 'git status' before committing the change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
of course it is interesting, as you can develop in different directions, not
only one, where you can try to make changes over multiple paths, and not just
one path.
It is easier to divide work into some paths when needed and organize them.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
as i understand, a diagram is the good way to draw the structures and the flow
of work from one version to another

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
the result is merging the modifications from one branch to the last modifications
from the other, i.e. me get one version containing the modifications from both
branches.
it is logical to be represented in the diagram in this way, as the result is
actually the result coming from both branches all the way to the last one.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
automatic merging,
pros: efficient, easy, making it easy step
cons: may have bugs, may not be what is exactly needed, may include extra items,
or may exclude needed items
manually merging,
pros: good control of what you want to include in your merge, giving more control
of the output
cons: may be too hard, long, may be complicated, rendering merge harder step.
