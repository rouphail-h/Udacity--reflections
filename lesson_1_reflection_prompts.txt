How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made it much easier to find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It is faster to get the older versions available, and can save you in case you
made a mistake and need to fix it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

automatic save, is more secure when you go for longer time and you forget to
commit, it would help in this case.
manual commit on the other hand gives more flexibility and ability to understand
the versions difference, but it can be risky if your forgot to commit.
A mix in my opinion would be the best.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

well, for programming usually the files are connected , and one version change
can include many files change at one time.
While for google docs, usually it is related to a document which has no connection
to any other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

very simple, git log gives you the history of commits , and git diff, can give
the exact added and deleted lines from it.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

indeed, it gives me the courage to try any change , whatsoever, since at any time
you can revert back and get the right version, or that in most cases you are
able to undo your changes.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

i need to know what I can use Git for ??
